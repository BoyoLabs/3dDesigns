# 3dDesigns
The following is a list of 3d designs I have done on onshape, or at least mostly on onshape, others will be noted. All of these have been verified to print and I have done so myself. If anything needs context, I'll give it.

## List goes most recent to oldest... for the most part...

### Chicken Feeder Scooper

* context: needed a basic 1 cups worth scooper for our 1 legged indoor chickens. Should have made the chicken have one leg but oh well. Printed fine with no supports. A bit of bridging.

### BL Scredriver

* context: I printed the LTT screwdriver and thought, why don't I make my own personal custom and more usable (than the LTT one) screwdriver? Heat set a bit extender in there and I was off and running. Printed at 50% infill for durability.

### Chess Award Pins

* context: Running a chess get together where we are giving out a bunch of little awards like this. Heat set some pins and in various colors for fun.

* context: My father in law does vinyl and was restoring a Silverline boat, but wanted to get the emblem into the vinyl, so we gave it a shot and well what do you know? IT WORKED! He did *not* use a heat method. But thats all I really know.
